This is a production-ready cutting-edge dockerized django CMS project example. It includes the necessary CMS plugins for an average website and a solid webpack configuration (webpack5 + scss + typescript + vue + live reloading for development).

The project can be deployed to any dockerized environment. We provide setup instructions for [divio](/docs/deployment-divio.md) and [heroku](/docs/deployment-heroku.md).

It's also possible to run this project locally out of the box, you can clone it and follow [the local setup instructions](/docs/local-setup-instructions.md) to try it out.
