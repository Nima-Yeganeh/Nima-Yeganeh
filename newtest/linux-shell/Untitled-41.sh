#You are given a file with four space separated columns containing the scores of students in three subjects. The first column contains a single character (A-Z), the student identifier. The next three columns have three numbers each. The numbers are between 0 and 100, both inclusive. These numbers denote the scores of the students in English, Mathematics, and Science, respectively. Your task is to identify those lines that do not contain all three scores for students.
#awk - pattern-directed scanning and processing language
awk '{if($4 =="") print("Not all scores are available for"), $1}'
