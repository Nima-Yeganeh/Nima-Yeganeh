# Given a list of countries, each on a new line, your task is to read them into an array. Then, concatenate the array with itself (twice) - so that you have a total of three repetitions of the original array - and then display the entire concatenated array, with a space between each of the countries' names.
# solution 2
arr=( $(cat) )
echo "${arr[@]}" "${arr[@]}" "${arr[@]}"
