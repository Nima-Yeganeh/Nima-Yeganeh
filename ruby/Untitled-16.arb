# Ruby Control Structures - Until

# This challenge has a beautiful one-liner answer.

# "A hacker practices on HackerRank until getting to a rating of O(1) read as (Oh-one)"

# Call the method coder.practice until coder.oh_one? becomes true.

# Use the until control structure.

# until is the logical equivalent of while not.


# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
coder.practice until coder.oh_one? == true
