# Global Unicast: Addresses that work like public IPv4 addresses. The organization that needs IPv6 addresses asks for a registered IPv6 address block, which is assigned as a global routing prefix. After that, only that organization uses the addresses inside that block of addresses; that is, the addresses that begin with the assigned prefix.

# Unique Local: Works somewhat like private IPv4 addresses, with the possibility that multiple organizations use the exact same addresses and with no requirement for registering with any numbering authority.

# Global Unicast: 2 or 3 (originally); all not otherwise reserved (today)
# Unique Local: FD
# Multicast: FF
# Link Local FE80
