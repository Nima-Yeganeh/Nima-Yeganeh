// Nestor was doing the work of his math class about three days but he is tired of make operations a lot and he 
// should deliver his task tomorrow. His mathâ€™s teacher gives him two numbers a and b. The problem consist of finding 
// the last digit of the potency of base a and index b. Help Nestor with his problem. You are given two integer numbers:
//  the base a (0 <= a <= 20) and the index b (0 <= b <= 2,147,483,000), a and b both are not 0.
//  You have to find the last digit of ab.

// Input
// The first line of input contains an integer t, the number of test cases (t <= 30). t test cases follow. 
// For each test case will appear a and b separated by space.

// Output
// For each test case output an integer per line representing the result

// Sample Input
// Input:
// 2
// 3 10
// 6 2

// Output:
// 9
// 6
