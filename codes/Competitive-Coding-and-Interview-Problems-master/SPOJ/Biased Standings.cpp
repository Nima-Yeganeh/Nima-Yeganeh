// Usually, results of competitions are based on the scores of participants. However, we are planning a change for the next year of IPSC. During the registration each team will be able to enter a single positive integer : their preferred place in the ranklist. We would take all these preferences into account, and at the end of the competition we will simply announce a ranklist that would please all of you.

// But wait... How would that ranklist look like if it won't be possible to satisfy all the requests?

// Suppose that we already have a ranklist. For each team, compute the distance between their preferred place and their place in the ranklist. The sum of these distances will be called the badness of this ranklist.

// Problem specification
// Given team names and their preferred placements find one ranklist with the minimal possible badness.

// Input specification
// The first line of the input file contains an integer T specifying the number of test cases. Each test case is preceded by a blank line.

// Each test case looks as follows: The first line contains N : the number of teams participating in the competition. Each of the next N lines contains a team name (a string of letters and numbers) and its preferred place (an integer between 1 and N, inclusive). No two team names will be equal.

// Output specification
// For each of the test cases output a single line with a single integer : the badness of the best ranklist for the given teams.

// Example
// Input:
// 2

// 7
// noobz 1
// llamas 2
// Winn3rz 2
// 5thwheel 1
// NotoricCoders 5
// StrangeCase 7
// WhoKnows 7

// 3
// ThreeHeadedMonkey 1
// MoscowSUx13 1
// NeedForSuccess 1

// Output:
// 5
// 3
// Explanation:
// In the first test case, one possible ranklist with the minimal badness is:

// 1. noobz
// 2. llamas
// 3. Winn3rz
// 4. 5thwheel
// 5. NotoricCoders
// 6. WhoKnows
// 7. StrangeCase
