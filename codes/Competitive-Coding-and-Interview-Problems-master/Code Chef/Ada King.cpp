// Chef Ada is training her calculation skills. She wants to place a king and some obstacles on a chessboard in such a way that the number of distinct cells the king can reach is exactly K.

// Recall that a chessboard has 8 rows (numbered 1 through 8) and 8 columns (numbered 1 through 8); let's denote a cell in row r and column c by (r,c).

// In one move, a king can move to any adjacent cell which shares a side or corner with its current cell and does not contain an obstacle. More formally, a king in a cell (r,c) can move to any cell (rn,cn) if (rn,cn) is a valid cell of the chessboard which does not contain an obstacle and (r−rn)2+(c−cn)2≤2.

// A cell (x,y) can be reached by a king if, after an arbitrary number of moves (including zero), the king is in the cell (x,y).

// Help Ada find any valid configuration of the board such that the king can reach exactly K distinct cells. It is guaranteed that such a configuration always exists. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.

// Input
// The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
// The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer K.
// Output
// For each test case, print 8 lines describing a chessboard, each containing 8 characters. For each valid i and j, the j-th character on the i-th line should be one of the following:

// 'O' if the cell (i,j) initially contains the king; there should be exactly one such cell
// 'X' if the cell (i,j) contains an obstacle
// '.' if the cell (i,j) is empty
