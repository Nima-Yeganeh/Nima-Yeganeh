/* Title - Compress the list */

// You are given a strictly increasing sequence of integers A1,A2,…,AN. Your task is to compress this sequence.

// The compressed form of this sequence is a sequence of ranges separated by commas (characters ','). A range is either an integer or a pair of integers separated by three dots (the string "..."). When each range a...b in the compressed form is decompressed into the subsequence (a,a+1,…,b), we should obtain the (comma-separated) sequence A again.

// For each maximal contiguous subsequence (a,a+1,…,b) of A such that b≥a+2, the compressed form of A must contain the range a...b; if b≤a+1, such a sequence should not be compressed into a range. A contiguous subsequence is maximal if it cannot be extended by at least one element of A next to it. It can be proved that the compressed form of any sequence is unique (i.e. well-defined).
