// Chef is playing a card game with his friend Morty Smith.

// The rules of the game are as follows:

// There are two piles of cards, pile A and pile B, each with N cards in it. Pile A belongs to Chef and pile B belongs to Morty.
// Each card has one positive integer on it
// The ‘power’ of a card is defined as the sum of digits of the integer on that card
// The game consists of N rounds
// In each round, both players simultaneously draw one card each from the top of their piles and the player who draws the card with higher power wins this round and gets a point. If the powers of both players' cards are equal then they get 1 point each.
// The winner of the game is the player who has more points at the end of N rounds. If both players have equal number of points then the game ends in a draw.
// The game is now over and Chef has told Morty to find the winner. Unfortunately, this task is too complex for him. Help Morty find the winner.

// Input:
// First line will contain T, number of testcases.
// The first line of each test case will contain N, the number of rounds played.
// The ith of the next N lines of each test case will contain Ai and Bi, the number on the card drawn by Chef and Morty respectively in round i.
// Output:
// For each test case, output two space separated integers on a new line:
// Output

// 0 if Chef wins,
// 1 if Morty wins,
// 2 if it is a draw,
// followed by the number of points the winner had.
// (If it is a draw then output either player’s points).
