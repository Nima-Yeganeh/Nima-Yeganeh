// Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

// A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

// Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
// Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
// Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
// Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

    bool isHappy(int n) {

        while(s.find(num)==s.end()){
            s.insert(num);
            num = digitSquaredSum(num);
        }
        return num==1;
    }
    int digitSquaredSum(int n){
        int sum = 0;
        while(n>0){
            int t = n%10;
            sum += (t*t);
            n/=10;
