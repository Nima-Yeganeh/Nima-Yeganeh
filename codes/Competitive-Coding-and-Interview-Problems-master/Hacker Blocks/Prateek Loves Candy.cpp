// Prateek recently graduated from college. To celebrate, he went to a candy shop and bought all the candies. The total cost was a number upto which there are n prime numbers (starting from 2). Since Prateek wants to minimize his cost, he calls you to help him find the minimum amount that needs to be paid. Being a student of Prateek bhaiya it is now your job to help him out :)

// Input Format
// First line contains a single integer denoting the number of test cases T. Next T lines contains a single integer N, denoting the number of primes required.

// Constraints
// T <= 10000

// It is guaranteed that the answer does not exceed 10^6.

// Output Format
// Print the minimum cost that needs to be paid.

// Sample Input
// 2
// 5
// 1
// Sample Output
// 11
// 2
// Explanation
// In the first case there are 5 primes upto 11(2,3,5,7,11).
