// Sanket has a string consisting of only 'a' and 'b' as the characters. Sanket describes perfectness of a string as the maximum length substring of equal characters. Sanket is given a number k which denotes the maximum number of characters he can change. Find the maximum perfectness he can generate by changing no more than k characters.

// Input Format
// The first line contains an integer denoting the value of K. The next line contains a string having only ‘a’ and ‘b’ as the characters.

// Constraints
// 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^6

// Output Format
// A single integer denoting the maximum perfectness achievable.

// Sample Input
// 2
// abba
// Sample Output
// 4
// Explanation
// We can swap the a's to b using the 2 swaps and obtain the string "bbbb". This would have all the b's and hence the answer 4.
// Alternatively, we can also swap the b's to make "aaaa". The final answer remains the same for both cases.
