# Objective 
# In this challenge, we review some basic concepts that will get you started with this series. You will need to use the same (or similar)
# syntax to read input and write output in challenges throughout HackerRank. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an
# instructional video!

# Task 
# To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. on a single line, and finally
# print the value of your variable on a second line.

# You've got this!

# Note: The instructions are Java-based, but we support submissions in many popular languages. You can switch languages using the
# drop-down menu above your editor, and the inputString variable may be written differently depending on the best-practice conventions
# of your submission language.


# Read a full line of input from stdin and save it to our dynamically typed variable, input_string.
inputString = raw_input()

# Print a string literal saying "Hello, World." to stdout.
print "Hello, World."

# TODO: Write a line of code here that prints the contents of input_string to stdout.
print inputString
