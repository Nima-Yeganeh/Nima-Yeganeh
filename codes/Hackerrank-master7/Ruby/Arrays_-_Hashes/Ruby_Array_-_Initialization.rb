# Ruby Array - Initialization

# One of the most commonly used data structures in Ruby is a Ruby Array, and below we see various methods of initializing a ruby array.

# Your task is to initialize three different variables as explained below.

# Initialize an empty array with the variable name array
# Initialize an array with exactly one nil element in it with the variable name array_1
# Initialize an array with exactly two elements with value 10 in it using the variable name array_2.


# Initialize 3 variables here as explained in the problem statement
array = []
array_1 = [nil]
array_2 = [10, 10]
