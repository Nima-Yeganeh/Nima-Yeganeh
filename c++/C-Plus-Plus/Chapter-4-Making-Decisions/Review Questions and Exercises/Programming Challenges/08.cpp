*	08. Color Mixer
*
*       The colors red, blue, and yellow are known as the primary
*       colors because they cannot be made by mixing other colors.
*       When you mix two primary colors, you get a second- ary color,
*       as shown here:
*
*       When you mix red and blue, you get purple.
*       When you mix red and yellow, you get orange.
*       When you mix blue and yellow, you get green.
*
*       Write a program that prompts the user to enter the names
*       of two primary colors to mix. If the user enters anything
*       other than “red,” “blue,” or “yellow,” the program should
*       display an error message. Otherwise, the program should
*       display the name of the secondary color that results by
*       mixing two primary colors.
