*	13. Book Club Points
*
*       Serendipity Booksellers has a book club that awards points
*       to its customers based on the number of books purchased each
*       month. The points are awarded as follows:
*
*       • If a customer purchases 0 books, he or she earns 0 points.
*       • If a customer purchases 1 book, he or she earns 5 points.
*       • If a customer purchases 2 books, he or she earns 15 points.
*       • If a customer purchases 3 books, he or she earns 30 points.
*       • If a customer purchases 4 or more books, he or she earns 60 points.
*
*       Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of
*       books that he or she has purchased this month and then displays
*       the number of points awarded.
