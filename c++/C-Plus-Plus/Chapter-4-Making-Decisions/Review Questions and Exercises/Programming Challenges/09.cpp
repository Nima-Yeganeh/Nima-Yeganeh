*
*	09. Change for a Dollar Game
*
*       Create a change-counting game that gets the user to enter the
*       number of coins required to make exactly one dollar. The program
*       should ask the user to enter the number of pennies, nickels,
*       dimes, and quarters. If the total value of the coins entered is
*       equal to one dollar, the program should congratulate the user
*       for winning the game. Otherwise, the program should display a
*       message indicating whether the amount entered was more than or
*       less than one dollar.
