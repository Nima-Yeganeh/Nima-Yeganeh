*	21. How Many Pizzas?
*
*       Modify the program you wrote in Programming Challenge 20
*       (Pizza Pi) so that it reports the number of pizzas you need
*       to buy for a party if each person attending is expected to eat
*       an average of four slices. The program should ask the user for
*       the number of people who will be at the party and for the
*       diameter of the pizzas to be ordered. It should then calculate
*       and display the number of pizzas to purchase.
