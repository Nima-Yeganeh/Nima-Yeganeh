*	23. STOCK TRANSACTION PROGRAM
*
*       Last month Joe purchased some stock in Acme Software, Inc.
*       Here are the details of the purchase:
*
*       • The number of shares that Joe purchased was 1,000.
*       • When Joe purchased the stock, he paid $45.50 per share.
*       • Joe paid his stockbroker a commission that amounted to 2%
*         of the amount he paid for the stock.
*
*       Two weeks later Joe sold the stock. Here are the details of
*       the sale:
*
*       • The number of shares that Joe sold was 1,000.
*       • He sold the stock for $56.90 per share.
*       • He paid his stockbroker another commission that amounted
*         to 2% of the amount he received for the stock.
*
*       Write a program that displays the following information:
*       • The amount of money Joe paid for the stock.
*       • The amount of commission Joe paid his broker when he
*         bought the stock.
*       • The amount that Joe sold the stock for.
*       • The amount of commission Joe paid his broker when he sold
*         the stock.
*       • Display the amount of profit that Joe made after selling
*         his stock and paying the two commissions to his broker.
*         (If the amount of profit that your program displays is a
*         negative number, then Joe lost money on the transaction.)
