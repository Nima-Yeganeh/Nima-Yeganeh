/**
 * In a program you need to store the identification numbers of 
 * 10 employees (as ints) and their weekly gross pay (as doubles).
 * 
 *      A) Define two arrays that may be used in parallel to store 
 *         the 10 employee identification numbers and gross pay amounts.
 * 
 *      B) Write a loop that uses these arrays to print each employeeâ€™s 
 *         identification number and weekly gross pay.
