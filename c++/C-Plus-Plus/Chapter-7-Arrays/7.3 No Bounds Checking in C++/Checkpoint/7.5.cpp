// What is “array bounds checking”? Does C++ perform it?
// Answer: "Array bounds checking" allows you to check if
// you are trying to access the value of an array that is not 
// within bounds of that array.
//
// C++ does not perform "array bounds checking". Therefore, if
// your not carefull in declaring and inserting data into an array,
// you could access subscripts that go beyond the boundaries of a 
// particular array.
