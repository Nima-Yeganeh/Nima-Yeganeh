10. The ____header_____ is the part of a function definition that shows the 
    function name, return type, and parameter list.

11. If a function doesn’t return a value, the word ____void_____ will appear 
    as its return type.

12. Either a function’s ____header_____ or its ____prototype_____ must precede all calls 
    to the function.

13. Values that are sent into a function are called ____arguments_____.

14. Special variables that hold copies of function arguments are 
    called ____parameters_____.

15. When only a copy of an argument is passed to a function, it is 
    said to be passed by _____value_____.

16. A(n) _____prototype____ eliminates the need to place a function definition 
    before all calls to the function.

17. A(n) _____local____ variable is defined inside a function and is not 
    accessible outside the function.

18. _____Global____ variables are defined outside all functions and are 
    accessible to any function within their scope.

19. _____Global Constant____ variables provide an easy way to share large amounts of 
    data among all the functions in a program.

20. Unless you explicitly initialize global variables, they are automatically 
    initialized to _____NULL or 0____.

21. If a function has a local variable with the same name as a global variable, 
    only the _____local____ variable can be seen by the function.

22. ___Static______ local variables retain their value between function calls.

23. The ____return_____ statement causes a function to end immediately.

24. ____Default_____ arguments are passed to parameters automatically if no argument 
    is provided in the function call.

25. When a function uses a mixture of parameters with and without default 
    arguments, the parameters with default arguments must be defined ____last_____.

26. The value of a default argument must be a(n) ____literal value_____.

27. When used as parameters, ____reference_____ variables allow a function to access 
    the parameter’s original argument.

28. Reference variables are defined like regular variables, except there 
    is a(n) _____ampersand (&)____ in front of the name.

29. Reference variables allow arguments to be passed by ____reference________.

30. The ____exit()_____ function causes a program to terminate.

31. Two or more functions may have the same name,as long as their____parameters_____are
    different.
