<-- Short Answer -->

1. Why do local variables lose their values between calls 
    to the function in which they are defined?

ANSWER: Local variables lose their values between calls
        because they terminate each time the function
        call returns a value.



2. What is the difference between an argument and a parameter 
    variable?

ANSWER: An argument is a value that is passed within a function
        call. While, a parameter declares the data type and the
        name of it's local variable.




3. Where do you define parameter variables?

ANSWER: In the function header.




4. If you are writing a function that accepts an argument and 
    you want to make sure the function cannot change the value 
    of the argument, what do you do?

ANSWER: Do not pass by reference.




5. When a function accepts multiple arguments, does it matter in 
    what order the arguments are passed?

ANSWER: Yes.




6. How do you return a value from a function?

ANSWER: with the return value preceding that value.




7. What is the advantage of breaking your applicationâ€™s code into 
    several small procedures?

ANSWER: The advantage is that the code becomes easier to manage.




8. How would a static local variable be useful?

ANSWER: a static local variable allows for the variable to 
        be changed and to stay changed after the function has
        been called.




9. Give an example where passing an argument by reference would 
    be useful.

ANSWER: Passing an argument by reference allows that variable to
        be change within the any function.
