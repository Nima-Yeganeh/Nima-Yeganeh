// 6.16 - What is the difference between a static local variable
// and a global variable?
/*
 * A static variable can be changed and does not terminate
 * after a function call has finished. A static variable 
 * can only be used within the function that it has been
 * initialized. Static local variables are not destroyed when 
 * a function returns.
 * 
 * A global variable can be used by any and all functions.
 *
