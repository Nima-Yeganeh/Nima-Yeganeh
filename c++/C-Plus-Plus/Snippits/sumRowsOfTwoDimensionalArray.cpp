// Sometimes you may need to calculate the sum of each row in 
// a two-dimensional array. For example, suppose a 
// two-dimensional array is used to hold a set of 
// test scores for a set of students. Each row in the 
// array is a set of test scores for one student. To get the 
// sum of a studentâ€™s test scores (perhaps so an average may 
// be calculated), you use a loop to add all the elements 
// in one row. The following code shows an example.
