Verify File Copying by MD5: GoodSync can compare files by their MD5 checksum or compare entire file bodies to ensure correct copying.
Automatic Reconnect for Remote Folders: GoodSync automatically reconnects remote folders if they lose connection during Analyze or Sync.
File Mod Time Translation For Non-Preserving File Systems: For file systems that do not preserve file modification time when copying, GoodSync implements a novel time translation technique that make mod time appear to be preserved by copy action.
Time Shifts Are Detected And Fixed: When modification time of number of files is different by the same whole number of hours, GoodSync can correct file modification time without copying the file.
Copy Extended Attributes: GoodSync copies extended attributes of files that are used to store custom icons on Mac.
Parallel Threads: You can run sync in several threads, working in parallel to achieve faster file transfer speed.
Exclude and Include Filters: Files can be excluded from synchronizationbased on name pattern, size, mod time.
Portable Paths for Removable Drives: You can specify folder path that starts with volume name, so that your volume is found no matter what disk letter it uses.

File Backup Made Simple with GoodSync
Thanks to GoodSync, backing up the files on your computer has never been easier or faster. With our award-winning backup software, you get the peace of mind knowing that your important documents and files are safe, even if you accidentally delete them or your computer crashes.

With GoodSync’s user-friendly interface, you can easily back up files by copying from a source folder on your computer to a destination folder. You have a variety of options for where the destination folder is located, plus all GoodSync file backups can be completed locally, through a network, or over the internet.

Restoring Your Files
One of the best features of GoodSync is how easy it is to restore lost or corrupted files.

Through the GoodSync backup software,
you can quickly and completely restore a computer following a crash or have the flexibility to restore only a small number of files after they have been accidentally deleted or corrupted.

For Business
All business processes rely on high availability of mission critical data and fast recovery in case of an error, theft, disaster, or malicious activities.

GoodSync for Business provides continuous and secure backup service for your mission critical data stored on any elements in your IT infrastructure, including servers, workstations, NAS devices, and cloud storage.

Speed and Efficiency
Our software employs a sophisticated synchronization algorithm that detects which files in the source folder have been changed since the last backup, and only backs up those files that have been changed by the user.

This is much more efficient than backing up the entire source folder every time files are backed up like traditional backup services.

Why Use GoodSync for File Backup?
Access: Unlike traditional file backup services, GoodSync directly backs up and updates the actual data files themselves in their native formats rather than images of the source data. In the event of data loss in the source folder, files in the destination folder can be launched immediately, thereby reducing any unnecessary downtime.
Convenience: GoodSync’s backup functionality can be set up to run automatically, eliminating the need to remember to run backups. GoodSync remembers for you!
Options: GoodSync gives you the most options for backing up your files- use what works best for you! GoodSync supports backup to flash drives, other laptops and desktops, external hard drives, FTP, SFTP, WebDAV and Amazon S3.

No Monthly Fees: Unlike many other backup solutions, we do not charge monthly fees for backups.

Top-Rated File Sync Software
If you’re someone who uses multiple computers and devices for work, school or fun, you know what a headache it is to keep your files up-to-date in all locations. GoodSync’s File Sync feature ensures that folders in two or more separate locations contain identical up-to-date files. If you add, change, or delete a file from one location, the synchronization process will add, change, or delete the same file at the other location(s).

Our software will not only synchronize all your data, but also analyze, filter, and display results through a user-friendly interface, ensuring you avoid duplicates and synchronize only the files that you need!

Keeping Files Synced
When two or more locations are synchronized with GoodSync, no matter where your files are located, the most current versions of those files is available at all locations, regardless of where and when it was last modified.

Although it is possible to manually copy files between directories, using GoodSync is faster and safer, as you are much less likely to accidentally delete files. Our powerful algorithm takes all the guesswork out of keeping your important files up-to-date, so don’t get caught without GoodSync!

For Business
Uninterrupted service and high availability are two key elements of any modern business process. Business continuity planning includes various data redundancy models trough different mission critical data synchronization processes.

GoodSync for Business offers continues, secure and real time data synchronization service between any elements in your IT infrastructure, including servers, workstations, NAS devices, and cloud storage.

Speed and Efficiency
Our software employs a sophisticated synchronization algorithm that detects which files in the source folder have been changed since the last sync, and only backs up those files that have been changed by the user.

This is much more efficient than syncing the entire source folder every time files are synced using traditional service.

Why Use GoodSync for File Synchronization?
Options: GoodSync can synchronize files located on a PC, Mac, smartphone, tablet, hard drive, network, USB, FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, or Amazon S3. The synchronization can be done locally, through a network or through the internet.

Convenience: You can choose to automate the syncing process at a given time of day or when a particular system action occurs, like when a USB drive is inserted or during system startup.
Unparalleled Technology: GoodSync's sophisticated algorithm and bit-by-bit synchronization ensures complete accuracy and protects against data loss. GoodSync is scalable enough to withstand synchronization jobs ranging from five files to five million files without fail.
No Monthly Fees: Unlike many other backup solutions, we do not charge monthly fees for data synchronization service.

GoodSync
Cloud Storage
Our own proprietary cloud storage offers the fastest, safest, and the most affordable way to securely and easily backup and restore data from any of your devices directly from GoodSync interface.

Fast Upload and Download Speed
GoodSync Cloud Storage speed is as close to the local disk as possible. All modern cloud based services regulate the speed in which you can upload and download your data, making transferring large or numerous files very time consuming. Our Cloud Storage is different and allows for numerous and large files to be uploaded and downloaded with no bandwidth throttling.

Built-in Block-Level Data Transfer
When a user changes a file, most backup and synchronization programs can identify that the file has changed and upload/download the entire file. With GoodSync Connect, we identify the specific parts (blocks) of the changed file and propagate only those changes. This significantly reduces backup time, network consumption, and storage requirements.

Instant Recovery Following a Connection Loss
If the file download or upload process is stopped, either by you or due to the connection loss, GoodSync Cloud Storage enables instant and seamless resume exactly at the point where it stopped. This significantly reduces backup time and network consumption.


Fast Upload and Download Speed
Almost all modern cloud based services regulate the speed in which you can upload and download your data, making transferring large or numerous files very time consuming. With GoodSync Connect, the data transfer speed depends only on the speed of your connection and its not throttled by any intermediate server.

Your Own Free Private Cloud
GoodSync Connect allows you to create your own private cloud using your existing infrastructure and not on 3rd party servers as in traditional cloud-based services. Turn your home computer or NAS device into a private cloud and access your data from any device anywhere.
