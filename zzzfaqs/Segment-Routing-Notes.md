# Segment Routing

1. What is Segment Routing?
Segment Routing is a new type of routing protocol that allows for more efficient and effective routing of traffic. Segment Routing allows for the creation of “segments” which are essentially groups of routes that can be more easily managed and monitored. This allows for a more efficient use of resources and can lead to better overall performance.

2. How does segment routing work?
Segment routing is a type of routing that uses individual segments, or paths, to route traffic. This type of routing can be used to provide more flexibility and control over traffic flow. Segment routing can be used in conjunction with other types of routing, such as MPLS, to provide a more robust and efficient routing solution.

3. Can you explain how to configure an MPLS network for segment routing?
In order to configure an MPLS network for segment routing, you will need to first enable the segment routing feature on all of the MPLS routers in the network. Once this has been done, you will then need to configure the segment routing policies on each of the routers. These policies will determine how the segment routing traffic will be routed through the network.

4. What are the benefits of using segment routing?
Segment routing has a number of benefits, chief among them being its scalability. Segment routing can be used to create very large networks with a large number of nodes without running into the same problems that can plague other routing protocols. Additionally, segment routing is very flexible, allowing for a great deal of customization in how traffic is routed. This can be very useful in optimizing networks for specific applications or traffic patterns.

5. What’s the difference between IGP and EGP in context with segment routing?
IGP, or Interior Gateway Protocol, is a routing protocol used to exchange routing information between routers within the same administrative domain. EGP, or Exterior Gateway Protocol, is a routing protocol used to exchange routing information between routers in different administrative domains. In the context of segment routing, IGP is used to distribute segment routing information within a network, while EGP is used to distribute segment routing information between networks.

6. What are some of the challenges associated with segment routing?
One challenge with segment routing is that it can be difficult to troubleshoot if something goes wrong. Another challenge is that it can be difficult to scale segment routing if you have a large network.

7. Do you need to use LDP along with SR? Why or why not?
No, you do not need to use LDP along with SR. LDP is only required if you want to use MPLS TE or other MPLS-based features.

8. What is a prefix SID?
A prefix SID is a type of Segment Routing identifier that is used to identify a particular prefix (or sub-prefix) of an IP address. By using prefix SIDs, routers can more easily and efficiently identify the next hop for a particular packet, as well as keep track of which prefixes have been visited by a particular packet. This can be especially helpful in situations where there are a large number of prefixes to keep track of, or where the prefixes are constantly changing.

9. What is the purpose of explicit tracking?
The purpose of explicit tracking is to provide a mechanism for a network device to track the progress of a packet as it is forwarded through the network. This allows the device to determine if the packet has been lost or if it has been delayed in transit.

10. Does Segment Routing provide any advantages over other alternatives like RSVP-TE, BGP, OSPF, ISIS, etc.?
Segment Routing provides a number of advantages over other alternatives. One of the main advantages is that it is much more scalable than other alternatives. Segment Routing can also provide better performance and is more flexible in terms of routing.

12. Can you give me examples of scenarios where segment routing would be helpful?
Segment routing can be helpful in a number of scenarios, but is particularly useful in cases where you need to route traffic around a failed link or node. By using segment routing, you can quickly re-route traffic around the failed link, which can help to avoid service disruptions. Segment routing can also be helpful in cases where you need to implement complex routing policies, or in cases where you need to optimize traffic flow.

13. Is it possible to run segment routing on top of another protocol such as IS-IS or OSPF?
Yes, it is possible to run segment routing on top of another protocol. This is known as “piggybacking” and can be used to provide additional functionality or to improve efficiency.

14. What are some of the main features provided by segment routing?
Segment routing provides a number of features that are beneficial for networking, including the ability to provide more efficient routing, the ability to simplify network configuration, and the ability to provide more flexibility in terms of routing options.

15. Are there any issues that can arise when running segment routing on top of BGP? If yes, then what are they?
There are a few potential issues that can come up when running segment routing on top of BGP. One is that BGP was not designed with segment routing in mind, so there may be compatibility issues. Additionally, segment routing can add a lot of complexity to the routing process, which can make it more difficult to troubleshoot problems that arise.

16. What are some of the limitations of segment routing?
One of the main limitations of segment routing is that it can be difficult to troubleshoot and debug because of the number of potential paths that a packet can take. Additionally, segment routing can put a strain on network resources because of the need to maintain state information for all potential paths.

17. What is the main advantage of having multiple paths for traffic flow rather than just one?
The main advantage of having multiple paths for traffic flow is that it can help to prevent congestion and improve overall network performance. By having multiple paths available, traffic can be routed around areas of congestion, which can help to keep things moving smoothly.

18. What do you understand about SR policies?
SR policies are a type of routing policy that can be used in order to control the path that traffic takes when traversing a network. SR policies can be used in order to optimize traffic flow or to meet specific service-level agreements.

19. Can you explain what a path vector is in the context of segment routing?
A path vector is a data structure that contains information about the path that a packet takes through a network. In the context of segment routing, the path vector is used to store information about the sequence of segments that a packet will travel through. This information can be used to determine the best route for a packet to take through the network, and to troubleshoot problems with the network.

20. What is your opinion on Cisco’s PNRP technology?
I believe that it is a very powerful tool that can help network operators to better manage and control their networks. I think it has the potential to greatly simplify the management of large networks, and I believe that it will become increasingly important in the future as networks continue to grow in size and complexity.
