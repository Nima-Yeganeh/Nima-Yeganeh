Segment Routing (SR) is a new network routing technology that is gaining popularity in the industry. As a result, more and more employers are looking for candidates with SR knowledge and experience. During your job interview, you can expect to be asked questions about SR in order to gauge your level of expertise. In this article, we will review some of the most commonly asked SR questions and provide tips on how to answer them.

Segment Routing Interview Questions and Answers
Here are 20 commonly asked Segment Routing interview questions and answers to prepare you for your interview:

1. What is Segment Routing?
Segment Routing is a new type of routing protocol that allows for more efficient and effective routing of traffic. Segment Routing allows for the creation of “segments” which are essentially groups of routes that can be more easily managed and monitored. This allows for a more efficient use of resources and can lead to better overall performance.

2. How does segment routing work?
Segment routing is a type of routing that uses individual segments, or paths, to route traffic. This type of routing can be used to provide more flexibility and control over traffic flow. Segment routing can be used in conjunction with other types of routing, such as MPLS, to provide a more robust and efficient routing solution.

3. Can you explain how to configure an MPLS network for segment routing?
In order to configure an MPLS network for segment routing, you will need to first enable the segment routing feature on all of the MPLS routers in the network. Once this has been done, you will then need to configure the segment routing policies on each of the routers. These policies will determine how the segment routing traffic will be routed through the network.

4. What are the benefits of using segment routing?
Segment routing has a number of benefits, chief among them being its scalability. Segment routing can be used to create very large networks with a large number of nodes without running into the same problems that can plague other routing protocols. Additionally, segment routing is very flexible, allowing for a great deal of customization in how traffic is routed. This can be very useful in optimizing networks for specific applications or traffic patterns.

5. What’s the difference between IGP and EGP in context with segment routing?
IGP, or Interior Gateway Protocol, is a routing protocol used to exchange routing information between routers within the same administrative domain. EGP, or Exterior Gateway Protocol, is a routing protocol used to exchange routing information between routers in different administrative domains. In the context of segment routing, IGP is used to distribute segment routing information within a network, while EGP is used to distribute segment routing information between networks.

6. What are some of the challenges associated with segment routing?
One challenge with segment routing is that it can be difficult to troubleshoot if something goes wrong. Another challenge is that it can be difficult to scale segment routing if you have a large network.

7. Do you need to use LDP along with SR? Why or why not?
No, you do not need to use LDP along with SR. LDP is only required if you want to use MPLS TE or other MPLS-based features.

8. What is a prefix SID?
A prefix SID is a type of Segment Routing identifier that is used to identify a particular prefix (or sub-prefix) of an IP address. By using prefix SIDs, routers can more easily and efficiently identify the next hop for a particular packet, as well as keep track of which prefixes have been visited by a particular packet. This can be especially helpful in situations where there are a large number of prefixes to keep track of, or where the prefixes are constantly changing.

9. What is the purpose of explicit tracking?
The purpose of explicit tracking is to provide a mechanism for a network device to track the progress of a packet as it is forwarded through the network. This allows the device to determine if the packet has been lost or if it has been delayed in transit.

10. Does Segment Routing provide any advantages over other alternatives like RSVP-TE, BGP, OSPF, ISIS, etc.?
Segment Routing provides a number of advantages over other alternatives. One of the main advantages is that it is much more scalable than other alternatives. Segment Routing can also provide better performance and is more flexible in terms of routing.

11. What are Adj SIDs?
Adj SIDs are Segment Routing identifiers that are used to identify individual adjacencies within a network. When a packet is sent from one node to another, the Adj SID is used to identify the next hop along the way. This allows for more efficient routing, as packets can be sent directly to their destination without having to go through intermediate nodes.

12. Can you give me examples of scenarios where segment routing would be helpful?
Segment routing can be helpful in a number of scenarios, but is particularly useful in cases where you need to route traffic around a failed link or node. By using segment routing, you can quickly re-route traffic around the failed link, which can help to avoid service disruptions. Segment routing can also be helpful in cases where you need to implement complex routing policies, or in cases where you need to optimize traffic flow.

13. Is it possible to run segment routing on top of another protocol such as IS-IS or OSPF?
Yes, it is possible to run segment routing on top of another protocol. This is known as “piggybacking” and can be used to provide additional functionality or to improve efficiency.

14. What are some of the main features provided by segment routing?
Segment routing provides a number of features that are beneficial for networking, including the ability to provide more efficient routing, the ability to simplify network configuration, and the ability to provide more flexibility in terms of routing options.

15. Are there any issues that can arise when running segment routing on top of BGP? If yes, then what are they?
There are a few potential issues that can come up when running segment routing on top of BGP. One is that BGP was not designed with segment routing in mind, so there may be compatibility issues. Additionally, segment routing can add a lot of complexity to the routing process, which can make it more difficult to troubleshoot problems that arise.

16. What are some of the limitations of segment routing?
One of the main limitations of segment routing is that it can be difficult to troubleshoot and debug because of the number of potential paths that a packet can take. Additionally, segment routing can put a strain on network resources because of the need to maintain state information for all potential paths.

17. What is the main advantage of having multiple paths for traffic flow rather than just one?
The main advantage of having multiple paths for traffic flow is that it can help to prevent congestion and improve overall network performance. By having multiple paths available, traffic can be routed around areas of congestion, which can help to keep things moving smoothly.

18. What do you understand about SR policies?
SR policies are a type of routing policy that can be used in order to control the path that traffic takes when traversing a network. SR policies can be used in order to optimize traffic flow or to meet specific service-level agreements.

19. Can you explain what a path vector is in the context of segment routing?
A path vector is a data structure that contains information about the path that a packet takes through a network. In the context of segment routing, the path vector is used to store information about the sequence of segments that a packet will travel through. This information can be used to determine the best route for a packet to take through the network, and to troubleshoot problems with the network.

20. What is your opinion on Cisco’s PNRP technology?
I believe that it is a very powerful tool that can help network operators to better manage and control their networks. I think it has the potential to greatly simplify the management of large networks, and I believe that it will become increasingly important in the future as networks continue to grow in size and complexity.

Scalability and simplicity is an important consideration when we talk about IP/MPLS networks. Traditional MPLS networks are complex and use LDP and IGP (ISIS and OSPF) as control plane protocols. LDP is used to label information exchange and IGP for Prefixing information exchange between neighbours.  A way to leverage IP/MPLS networks is use of segment routing which offers complete control over forwarding paths and does not require any additional protocol; it leverages existing MPLS services and hardware hence does not require new infrastructure to move or migrate to segment routing.

What is Segment Routing?
The standard of segment routing is defined by the IETF SPRING working group in RFC 8402. In an IP/MPLS network ‘segments’ present network links, network nodes or services. A path or route which an IP packet traverses in a network goes through intersections represented with link segments and network service represents destination. In an IP/MPLS network a node segment represents an MPLS enabled router, a link segment represents a connection between two adjacent routers, and a service segment represents a customer VPN service (Layer 3 or layer 2 VPN). 

Segment routing uses a source-based routing scheme where a network node steers a packet based on a list of instructions carried in a packet header called ‘segments’. The list of segments carried in a packet header give a strict and loose specification of the required network path or tunnel thus eliminating the need for transit nodes to maintain path information. 

Components of Segment Routing
There are some fundamental components of segment routing as under. 

Segment Routing(SR) domain – a collection of nodes which participate in SR protocols. Within an SR domain a node can execute ingress, transit or egress procedures.
SR path – an ordered list of segments which connect an SR ingress node to SR egress node following least cost path principal
SR segment – A forwarding instruction which causes a packet to traverse a section of network topology. SR defines any SR segment types and two used most often are adjacent and prefixed ones. An adjacency is a strict forward single hop tunnel. A prefix is a multihop tunnel which uses equal cost multihop-aware shortest path link to reach each prefix. 

How does Segment Routing work?
When a packet arrives at SR ingress node, it is subjected to policy.
If the packet matches the conditions for an SR path as per policy the SR ingress node encapsulates the packet in SR tunnel which traverses an SR path segment by segment.
Each segment in the SR path terminates at the endpoint of the segment.
When a packet arrives at the endpoint it is examined for the outermost packet label or header to get the corresponding segment.
It then pops the outermost label or header and forward packet to the next endpoint segment.
This process continues until the packet reaches its final destination which might be by SR egress node.
When the packet reaches the SR egress node the node will determine if the packet is at the end of the path.
If it is end of path SR header information is removed and packet if forwarded to its destination finally. 

Advantages of Segment Routing 
Simplification of network and reduction in resource utilization making easier to manage and operate network
Reduction in the number of nodes which needs to be touched for path provisioning and changes. Network is more responsive to changes, agile and flexible
Provides application QoS and maps network services to end users and applications as they traverse across the network 
Path resiliency during network outages through head end restoration and topology independent loop free alternate (TI-LFA) technology
Bandwidth reservation with simplified traffic engineering when used as WAN PCE controller 
Reduction in risk of transition as it offers heterogeneous support for multiple forwarding planes (MPLS and IPv6 as well)
Facilitate closed loop automation by continuous assessment of real time network conditions such as packet flow to network devices, network behaviour monitoring and performance, 
Also used for network slicing to enhance end user experience by defining specific network paths as per set requirements
