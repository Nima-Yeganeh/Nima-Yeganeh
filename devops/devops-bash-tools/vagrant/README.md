Hari Sekhon's Vagrant Lab
=========================

### Inventory

`kubernetes` - Kubernetes cluster built by `kubeadm`. Used this to pass my [CKA](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka/) exam ([Certified Kubernetes Administrator](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka/)), you need something like this for the official [CNCF CKA course - Kubernetes Fundamentals](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/kubernetes-fundamentals/) (as of 2019-2020)

`ubuntu` - base build (fork to build new ubuntu-based labs quickly)
