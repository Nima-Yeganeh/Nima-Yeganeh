#Leviathan 0

#First we need to log into the level using ssh given and the username

ssh leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p2223 -l leviathan0

#the level starting instructions gives us the password

leviathan0

#Since there is not any instructions besides to check the directories
#I start to look at the files with ls and ls -la

ls 

ls -la

#I can now see there is some files
#but I also want to see what cat /etc/leviathan_pass does

cat /etc/leviathan_pass

#it says that it is a directory
#lets go in and read the directory

cd /etc/leviathan_pass

#we can now see that there are all the levels and passwords. Cool beans
#so there are 7 levels and passwords
#lets see if any of the files early hold anything like ".backup"
#I need to exit then log back in with the password to go back to the files
#then access .backup

cd .backup

#this shows some files and bookmarks
#it mentions leviathan1 so lets grep to quick find leviathan1
#and see what's in leviathan1 bookmarks

grep leviathan1 bookmarks.html

#The quick find reads 
#" "http://leviathan.labs.overthewire.org/passwordus.html | This will be fixed later, the password for leviathan1 is rioGegei8m" ADD_DATE="1155384634" LAST_CHARSET="ISO-8859-1" ID="rdf:#$2wIU71">password to leviathan1</A> "
