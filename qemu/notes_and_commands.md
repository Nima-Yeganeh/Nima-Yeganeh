Windows Home
QEMU works best with Hyper-V, but it is not available with Windows Home edition. We recommend using VirtualBox hypervisor with this version.

However, if you still wish to use QEMU, it is possible to install HAXM.

Important

HAXM only works with Intel CPUs. It is not compatible with AMD CPUs.
