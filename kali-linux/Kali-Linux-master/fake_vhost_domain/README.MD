- The next step is we create an exploit which will oblige the user to open your faceboook.com, sorry, it is my mistake facebook.com :D ;)
 The point is, the user must pass through you like a gateway of his router and translate all his traffic to your `HTTP` bullshits with the same content and apps ;) :) not with the original `HTTPS` ;) :D...
