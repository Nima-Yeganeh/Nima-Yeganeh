# Broadband Network Gateway
# 40E
# NE40E
# Campus Aggregation Network, IDC network and Interconnection networks between Enterprise Campuses
# The NE40E can be flexibly deployed at the edge or core of IP or MPLS networks, simplifying network structure.
# With up to 1.44Tbps switching capacity and 800Mbps forwarding throughput, these core routers still have a compact design that makes them ideal for enterprise campus networks. Based on Huawei's unified, mature, multi-service, Versatile Routing Platform (VRP), the NE40 Series offers intelligent and powerful L3 functions and supports various traffic classification methods that can classify services with great granularity and flexibility.

# Up to 1.44Tbps switching capacity and 800Mbps forwarding throughput
# Supports various traffic classification methods and service aware policies for Hierarchical Quality of Service (HQoS)
# Integrates intelligent functions for Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC) applications
# Unified platform and unified management – supporting end eplug-n-play and end-to-end service configuration

# The NE40E can support at maximum a 480G Line Card, which fulfills the increasing network requirements of customers. The powerful 480G line card can support both 100 GE and 10 GE port types, to provide customers with flexible configurations. With excellently developed chipset technology and fine design techniques, the NE40E provides sustainable high bandwidth capacity for the future.

# The NE40E supports a variety of IPv6 features including IPv6 leased line, dual stack, tunneling, and translation. The NE40E supports Next-Hop Separation to optimize the IPv6 convergence time and supports larger IPv6 FIB and CGN cards of 160G throughput to improve the scalability. These help to provide comprehensive solutions for high performance in transition from IPv6 to IPv4 and allow each provider to determine their transition strategy most suitable for their own network.

# The NE40E provides reliability protection at different levels, including the equipment, network, and service levels. The NE40E can provide a multi-level reliability solution that completely meets the reliability requirements of different services. The NE40E lays the foundation for enterprise services with a system availability of 99.999%.

# The NE40E provides redundancy backup for key components. These key components support hot swapping and hot backup. The NE40E also uses technologies, such as Non-Stop Routing (NSR), Non-Stop Forwarding (NSF), and In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU), to ensure uninterrupted service forwarding. The NE40E supports packet buffering of 200 ms, ensuring no packet loss in the case of traffic bursts — guaranteeing high-quality service experience for users.

# The NE40E uses the following technologies to provide network-level reliability: IP Fast Reroute (FRR), Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) FRR, VPN FRR, TE FRR, hot standby, fast convergence of Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP), BGP, and multicast routes, Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), Rapid Ring Protection Protocol (RRPP), trunk load balancing and backup, hardware-based Bi-directional Forwarding Detection (BFD) of 3.3 ms, MPLS OAM, Ethernet OAM, and routing protocol/port/VLAN damping. The NE40E provides an end-to-end protection with no service interruption.

# The NE40E uses the following technologies to provide service-level reliability for L2VPNs and L3VPNs: VPN FRR, E-VRRP, VLL FRR, Ethernet OAM, Y.1731, PW redundancy, E-Trunk, and E-Automatic Protection Switching (APS) These technologies ensure stable and reliable service operation with no service interruption.

# Based on its mature Versatile Routing Platform (VRP), the NE40E excels in reliability, expansibility, and maintainability. It supports various features to satisfy the requirement to transmit multiple services, including Hierarchical Virtual Private LAN Service (HVPLS), Virtual Leased Line (VLL), Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN), Layer 3 VPN (L3VPN), multicast VPN, 802.1Q-in-802.1Q (QinQ), Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) mapping, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) relay/snooping, IPSec, NAT, and GRE. NE40E supports Protocol Independent Multicast-Source Specific Multicast (PIM-SSM), Internet Group Membership Protocol Version 3 (IGMPv3), and MAC + IP + VLAN user binding. On the high-reliability MANs based on the NE40E, ISP can provide Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) services, family multi-play services, IP leased line services, enterprise interconnection services, and enterprise VPN services.

# The NE40E provides Multi-Service Edge (MSE) features to manage and control DHCP/IP over Ethernet (IPoE)/leased line access users. The MSE mainly provides dynamic user access, user management, and user-based authentication, accounting, and QoS scheduling. In addition, the MSE implements Bandwidth-on-Demand (BoD) for different services of enterprise users and for DHCP individual users and changes the unified charging mode to the charging mode based on value-added services, which implements user-centered refined service operation.
