# The ME60 consists of a range of multi-service control gateways developed by Huawei to serve as broadband network gateways (BNGs) for broadband service access and service provider nodes on IP/MPLS networks.

# The ME60 series includes devices that are applicable to networks of different scales: ME60-X8A and ME60-X16A.

# Multi-service access: supports PPPoE, IPoE, and L2TP for user access.

# Large capacity: supports 800G high-performance broadband access boards, 400G large-capacity CGN service boards, and up to 1 million concurrent users per device, meeting requirements for rapidly growing broadband services and laying a solid foundation for broadband evolution.

# Multi-service transport: supports flexible deployment of multiple services, such as EVPN, L2VPN, L3VPN, MVPN, SR-MPLS, and SRv6.

# Value-added services: works with the service platform to provide value-added services such as intelligent acceleration through EDSG technologies, equipping networks with monetization capabilities.

# Smooth evolution to cloud-based networks: centrally manages BNG services on the cloud-based plane through software upgrade, optimizing network resources.
